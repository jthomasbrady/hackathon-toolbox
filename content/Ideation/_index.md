### Let's brainstorm as a team 🤔
```
  1. Have you been given a predefined set of problems?
  
  2. Do you have a problem in mind?
  
  3. Ask everyone in the team, 'What problem do they want to solve?'
  
  4. On a "white board" note down the sugestions made by each member
                                                                             
  5. Discuss the proposed problems and vote to select the one your team will tackle
```

### Let's define and understand the problem 🎯
```
  1. 'Who' does this problem affect?
  
  2. What is the 'Social & Economic impact' of this problem?
  
  3. What is the 'Environmental Impact' of this problem?
  
  4. What is the 'Technological Impact' of this problem?
  
  5. What is the 'Human Impact' of this problem?
```
### Let's start defining what a solution might look like 🔎
```
  1. Has this problem already been 'solved' by someone before?
  
  2. Why has this problem not been solved 'before'?
  
  3. How can we 'resolve/workaround' the barriers to solve this problem?

  4. On a "White Board" each member writes down potential solutions

  5. Discuss the merits/demerits of each proposed solution

  6. Vote and converge towards a candidate solution to start working on
```
### Let's get started with the solution design

```
1. Assuming no constraints, what does the full complete solution look like?

2. Assuming no contraints how does this solution address the "Impacts" we discussed while understanding the problem?

3. What is the commercial viability of the solution?

```

### Minimum Viable Product ❤️

```
1. Consider what is an achievable target for your time frame
   
2. Keeping the constraints in mind, what is a relatively simple way to showcase your solution
   
3. Leverage your team members, what can you produce in the time that you have?

4. Is there anything you can "reuse/repurpose" from your day to day work?
```
